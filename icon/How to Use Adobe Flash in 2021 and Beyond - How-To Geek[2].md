In this article, we will show you three possible methods to use Adobe Flash Player on your Hisense Smart TV: using an open-source Flash Player emulator, using a virtual machine, or using an external device.
 
## Method 1: Using an Open-Source Flash Player Emulator
 
One of the easiest and safest ways to use Flash content on your Hisense Smart TV is to use an open-source Flash Player emulator called Ruffle. Ruffle is a free software that can run .SWF files (Flash files) on modern operating systems, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. Ruffle does not require any installation or browser plug-in, and it can run Flash content directly from your local files or from the web.
 
To use Ruffle on your Hisense Smart TV, you will need a computer that can connect to your TV via HDMI cable or wireless display. You will also need to download Ruffle from its official website: https://ruffle.rs/. Here are the steps to follow:
 
1. Download the latest version of Ruffle for your operating system from https://ruffle.rs/.
2. Extract the ZIP file and open the folder.
3. Double-click on the ruffle\_desktop.exe file to launch Ruffle.
4. Drag and drop the .SWF file that you want to play on Ruffle's window, or click on the "Open" button and browse for the file.
5. Connect your computer to your Hisense Smart TV via HDMI cable or wireless display.
6. Switch your TV's input source to your computer's screen.
7. Enjoy watching or playing Flash content on your Hisense Smart TV.

## Method 2: Using a Virtual Machine
 
Another way to use Flash content on your Hisense Smart TV is to use a virtual machine. A virtual machine is a software that can create a simulated environment of another operating system on your computer. For example, you can run Windows XP on your Windows 10 computer using a virtual machine. This way, you can use older versions of software that are not compatible with your current operating system.
 
To use a virtual machine on your Hisense Smart TV, you will need a computer that can connect to your TV via HDMI cable or wireless display. You will also need to download and install a virtual machine software such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player. You will also need an ISO image of an older operating system that supports Flash Player, such as Windows XP or Windows 7. You will also need to download an older version of Flash Player that does not have the kill switch, such as version 32.0.0.371. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Download and install a virtual machine software such as VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player from their official websites: https://www.virtualbox.org/ or https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html.
2. Download an ISO image of an older operating system that supports Flash Player, such as Windows XP or Windows 7 from a reliable source.
3. Create a new virtual machine using the virtual machine software and the ISO image of the operating system.
4. Start the virtual machine and complete the installation and setup of the operating system.
5. Download an older version of Flash Player that does not have the kill switch, such as version 32.0.0.371 from https://archive.org/details/flashplayerarchive.
6. Install Flash Player on the virtual machine by opening the installer and following the steps.
7. Connect your computer to your Hisense Smart TV via HDMI cable or wireless display.
8. Switch your TV's input source to your computer's screen.
9. Open a browser that supports Flash Player on the virtual machine, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox.
