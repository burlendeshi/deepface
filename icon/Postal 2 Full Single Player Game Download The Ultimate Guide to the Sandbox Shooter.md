- Use the quicksave and quickload features often. Postal 2 is a game where anything can happen, and sometimes things can go wrong very quickly. You don't want to lose your progress or get stuck in a bad situation. To quicksave, press F5 on your keyboard. To quickload, press F9. You can also use the pause menu to save and load manually.
- Explore the map and look for secrets. Postal 2 has a large and detailed map with many hidden areas, items, and easter eggs. You can find weapons, ammo, health, money, armor, and other useful things by exploring the map. You can also discover some funny and bizarre secrets, such as a secret base, a UFO, a giant catfish, and more.
- Be creative with your weapons and items. Postal 2 has a variety of weapons and items that you can use in different ways. For example, you can use scissors to cut off people's heads or limbs, you can use matches to light people or objects on fire, you can use catnip to attract cats or make them attack people, you can use gasoline to create explosions or trails of fire, and more. Experiment with different combinations and see what happens.
- Choose your difficulty level wisely. Postal 2 has four difficulty levels: Liebermode (easy), Hestonworld (normal), Enhanced (hard), and They Hate Me (very hard). The difficulty level affects how much damage you take and deal, how many enemies you encounter, how aggressive they are, how much ammo and health you find, and how much money you need for certain tasks. Choose the difficulty level that suits your skill and preference.
- Have fun and don't take it too seriously. Postal 2 is a game that is meant to be humorous and satirical. It is not a realistic or accurate representation of real life or real people. It is also not a game that encourages or condones violence or crime. It is just a game that lets you do whatever you want in a virtual world. Don't get offended or upset by the game's content or mechanics. Just have fun and enjoy the game.
